# vuedo

A simple Laravel & Vue Todo App (Vuedo)

Tasks have the following:

    Title
    Description
    Category
    Due Date

We need the ability to:

    Create a Task
    Edit a Task
    Change Task Category
    Archive a Task (with the ability of restoration)

We'd need a View of categories (like Trello)

Laravel project, this does NOT have to look great, just enough to showcase the above, tests would be nice to see.
